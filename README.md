**Topics covered**:
`principle and philosophy of the Linux operating system`

`working in the command line, basic commands, help`

`working with files and directories-creating, writing, jamming`

`input and output of commands, redirects, pipes`

`searching for data in text files`

`basics of scripting`

`the basic structure of the components of the Linux system, information about the storage of system files and their structure`
